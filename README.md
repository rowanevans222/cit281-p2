# cit281-p2
Refactored a JavaScript file to improve structure by using clean, modular functions and eliminating global variables. Practiced using Git through both CLI and VSCode, including staging, committing, and managing a .gitignore file. Also rewrote the code using function expressions and captured a diff screen in VSCode. This project strengthened my understanding of version control, function design, and working with Node.js outside of a web server.
